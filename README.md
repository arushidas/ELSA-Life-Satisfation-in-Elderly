# ELSA-Life-Satisfation-in-Elderly
An Evaluation of Factors Affecting Life Satisfaction in the Elderly Using ELSA Wave 7 Dataset


### Introduction:
This study aims to investigate the factors influencing life satisfaction among older adults in the United Kingdom. It analyzes a dataset consisting of 9,666 individuals aged 50 and above. The study utilizes Chi-square Tests and Logistic Regression to examine the impacts of various factors, including sex, marital status, self-reported health, loneliness, financial management with a partner, sense of happiness, little money to spend on needs, and age, on life satisfaction.


### Dataset:
The study utilizes the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), which is a comprehensive and publicly available longitudinal dataset containing data on adults aged 50 and above. ELSA provides various measures, including performance tests, anthropometric variables, biomarkers, cognitive assessments, and socioeconomic statistics.


### Methodology:
Descriptive statistics, Chi-squared analysis, and logistic regression are employed in this study. Frequency tables are used to summarize the distribution of variable answers, Chi-squared tests examine the relationships between independent factors and life satisfaction, and logistic regression builds a model to analyze the relationship between life satisfaction and the independent variables.


### Research Gaps:
Previous research has focused on specific aspects of life satisfaction or aggregate measures of life satisfaction in different regions. However, there is a gap in understanding the factors influencing life satisfaction among older adults in the United Kingdom, particularly within the context of the ELSA dataset. Additionally, the study identifies limitations such as self-reported health as a subjective indicator and missing data, suggesting areas for future research.


### Conclusion:
The study finds that marital status has the greatest impact on life satisfaction among older adults, with separated, divorced, or widowed individuals experiencing significantly lower life satisfaction. The findings suggest the importance of social involvement, proper financial management with a partner, and spending on necessities for older individuals to feel content with their lives. Maintaining good physical health and addressing loneliness are also significant factors. The study emphasizes the need for national strategies that encourage older adults to engage in their communities, addressing health, social, and economic concerns.
